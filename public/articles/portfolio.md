# Cursor Chat

![demo](https://s12.gifyu.com/images/SZGTo.gif)

This project is an experiment where I was exploring websockets through the use of Socket.io in order to create an experience where users could chat between clients while being able to see the cursor movements between other users.

This is still a work in progress as I intend to add proximity voice chat that would allow users to chat with their microphones, and the volume of each user relative to your position would be based on their distance from you in the 2d space.

## Tech Stack
- **NextJS + Typescript**: Website framework
- **TailwindCSS**: Styling
- **NodeJS + Typescript**: Backend framework
- **Socket.io**: Websockets library
