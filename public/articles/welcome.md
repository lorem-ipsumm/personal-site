Here you can find some of my projects, articles, random thoughts, and other fun stuff. I am a full stack developer and designer with a specialization in crypto and DeFi. I've been in crypto for 4 years and have worked with several protocols across a variety of networks. Outside of crypto I do freelance fullstack development. In my free time I build fun and interactive web-based experiences.

This site serves as a place where I dump my thoughts on various topics as well as write tutorials whenever I see fit. It will also serve as a place where I document various money making strategies in and outside of DeFi. I have a large interest in searching for arbitrage opportunities across markets, and prefer these strategies over yield farming and/or directional trading, as those methods come with some additional risk. I prefer the opportunities that I can get in and out of within an hour.

Aside from profitable opportunities in crypto I have started to branch out into the broader sass/micro-sass field. I have a few products that I'm building out at the moment, and will start documenting them here. At the time of writing this it is currently December 31st 2023 and one of my goals for 2024 is to start actually launching products. Like all hobby developers I have a massive backlog of projects that will never see the light of day, but I want to fix that by actually releasing my projects to the public. 

That being said, I plan on documenting and experimenting with a wide variety of different strategies and techniques. If you want to collaborate on any project or you'd like me to build something for you, feel free to reach out to me.
