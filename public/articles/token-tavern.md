Token Tavern is a token gated site that allows token holders to access voice chat rooms that exist on a 2D plane allowing for interactive chats between token holders. Each user can see the cursor of other users and can use their microphones to talk to each other in real time. Users can also send text chat messages that appear above their cursors. There is a proximity audio feature that sets the volume to each user around you relative to the distance between your cursor and theirs. This enables the ability for users to have multiple conversations in different parts of the 2D space.

Unfortunately I cannot demo the voice chat functionality for you, however trust me when I say there is a certain amount of "magic" that you feel when you're in a room talking with someone. It's even more interesting when you have proximity audio enabled, as it gives a sense of real presence in the room.

The cover image for this blog post is a picture of a space that I hosted on FriendTech. Through FriendTech users can host voice chats with their fellow club key holders. You can envision this as token gated Twitter/X spaces which allows for private voice chat among people with shared interests. The launch on FriendTech has gone relatively well, and as a result I am extending this to the broader crypto space through the implementation of ERC20 tokens. 

The target audience for this application is ERC20 token holders that would like have private chats with their fellow token holders. While there are some solutions to this problem that exist (discord/telegram chats with token verification), however this will exist purely as a crypto app that doesn't require any integration with existing social media sites, allowing users to maintain a level of separation between their crypto wallets and their social media accounts if desired.

The desired user experience is to give users a sense of novelty from being able to interact with fellow token holders in a unique way. The 2D space and proximity audio gives the feeling of actually being in a space with other people. This can be thought of as a public square comprised of people with shared interests.

## Future Feature Ideas

There are quite a bit of features that I would like to add as the current version is merely a proof of concept to show that this is possible. These are some of the future ideas that I like the most:

- ENS name support
	- It may be a hassle to remember people's address when addressing them over voice, so it would be nice to have some kind of name system that users can refer to.
- NFT profile pictures
	- Allowing users to display their NFTs as profile pictures on the canvas would let users show off their NFTs as well as give their cursor more of a personal feel.
- Canvas painting / trails
	- Similar to before this allows for customization of one's cursor further giving a personal feel.
- Private rooms with custom token requirements 
	- There could be rooms that require a certain composition of tokens (1 WETH, 50 USDC, 3 XYZ)
	- Room creators could also whitelist specific addresses
- NFT rooms
	- Aside from supporting ERC20 tokens, NFT holders would likely want to have their own rooms as a place to hang out that isn't accessible to everyone.

## Conclusion

This is an idea that I've had for a few years now, and I'm glad I'm finally putting in the work to bring it to life. I initially had no intention of integrating it with crypto, but there is such a strong overall community as well as sub-communities that led me to the conclusion that it would work very well in this environment.

I will be applying for the [Base OnChain Summer](https://base.mirror.xyz/HoH9cZVi8CMdvxVUNjvOzceUPVQcVZvvkf8ZbCOVOco) program in order to get some support and potentially more eyes on the product, but regardless of that program, I plan on adding more features as time goes on, as I think there is something novel and very interesting here. If you have any feature ideas or want to hop in a chat room to talk let me know!
